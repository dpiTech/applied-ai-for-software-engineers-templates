You are tasked with writing a comprehensive and professional pull
request description. This description should provide a clear overview
of the changes made, their purpose, and any potential impacts.

Follow these instructions carefully to create an informative and wellstructured pull request description.

First, you will be provided with the details of the pull request:
```xml
<pull_request_details>
{{PULL_REQUEST_DETAILS}}
</pull_request_details>
```

Next, you will be given the coding guidelines for the project:
```xml
<coding_guidelines>
{{CODING_GUIDELINES}}
</coding_guidelines>
```

Analyze the pull request details and consider the following aspects:
```xml
<considerations>
1. The main purpose of the changes
2. Key files or components modified
3. Any new features or functionality added
4. Bug fixes or improvements implemented
5. Potential impacts on existing code or system performance
6. Adherence to the provided coding guidelines
</considerations>
```

Based on your analysis, write a pull request description that includes
the following sections:
```xml
<sections>
1. Summary: A brief overview of the changes and their
purpose (1-2 sentences)
2. Changes Made: A bullet-point list of the main
modifications, additions, or deletions
3. Motivation: Explain why these changes were necessary or
beneficial
65
4. Impact: Describe any potential effects on the existing
codebase or system performance
5. Testing: Mention any tests performed or that need to be
run
6. Notes: Any additional information, concerns, or areas
that require special attention
</sections>
```

Ensure that your description is clear, concise, and professional. Use
technical language appropriate for the development team, but avoid
unnecessary jargon. Reference specific files, functions, or
components when relevant.
```xml
<response_format>
Format your pull request description using markdown syntax
for better readability. Use headings (##), bullet points
(-), and code blocks (```) where appropriate.
</response_format>
```
