You are tasked with writing comprehensive documentation for a
piece of code. Your goal is to create clear, concise, and informative
documentation that will help other developers understand and use
the code effectively.

Here is the code you need to document:
```xml
<code>
{{CODE}}
</code>
```

The code is written in the following programming language:
```xml
<language>
{{LANGUAGE}}
</language>
```

To approach this task, follow these instructions:
```xml
<instructions>
1. Carefully read and analyze the entire code.
2. Identify the main components of the code (e.g.,
functions, classes, methods, important variables).
3. Understand the purpose and functionality of each
component.
4. Document each component, following the guidelines below.
</instructions>
```

Guidelines for writing documentation:
```xml
<guidelines>
1. File-level documentation:
- Provide a brief overview of the file's purpose and
contents at the top of the file.
- Include any necessary import statements or dependencies.
- Mention the author and creation date if relevant.
2. Function/Method documentation:
- Describe the purpose of each function or method.
- Explain the parameters (inputs) and their types.
- Describe the return value and its type.
- Mention any exceptions that may be raised.
- Provide a brief example of how to use the function if
appropriate.
3. Class documentation:
- Explain the purpose and behavior of the class.
- Describe important attributes and their types.
- Document the constructor and its parameters.
- Mention any inheritance or important relationships with
other classes.
4. Variable documentation:
- For important variables, especially those with nonobvious purposes, provide a brief explanation.
5. Complex logic documentation:
- For any complex algorithms or logic, provide a high-level
explanation of how it works.
6. TODO comments:
- If there are any incomplete features or known issues,
mark them with TODO comments.
</guidelines>
```

Formatting and style:
```xml
<formatting>
1. Use the appropriate comment syntax for the given
programming language.
2. Keep comments concise but informative.
3. Use proper grammar and punctuation.
4. Maintain consistent indentation and formatting.
5. Follow any established documentation standards for the
given language (e.g., JSDoc for JavaScript, docstrings for
Python).
</formatting>
```

Please provide your documented code inside a code block (```).
Ensure that your documentation is thorough, clear, and follows the
guidelines provided above.
